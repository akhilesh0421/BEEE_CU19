# BEEE LED Flasher
**Concept Used**:

The entire circuit is build in the concept of input and output. We give an input and according to it the circuits gives an output in the form of flashing of LED. The LED flashes according to the instruction uploaded in the Arduino board. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input and output pins. All the instruction executed by the board are given to it using a program written in C programming language. For This experiment we use digital pin 13 as output. The positive terminal of the LED is connected to the digital pin 13 and the negative terminal is connected to the ground of the Arduino board.

**Learning & Observation**:

After doing this experiment I became familiar with circuit boards. Now I can distinguish between the input and output pins of a board easily. I also observed that how a simple change in code can affect the blinking of the LED.

**Problem Troubleshooting**:

I encountered the problem in my code only that the code wasn't working as expected. So, I re-examined the code and corrected it.

**Precautions**:

Precautions that one should take while doing his project are given below:

1. Make sure you correctly select the board and port in the "Tools" option in Arduino software.
2. Handle the Arduino board carefully as a simple damage can made the hardware useless.
3. Keep in mind that you should write program that is small in size as it came with low inbuilt memory.
4. Carefully connect the positive terminal to the output pin of the circuit as any wrong connection would make flasher to not work.

**Learning Outcomes**:

Trough this experiment I came to learn about the Arduino board and working of it. Before doing this experiment whenever I had seen a LED flasher I was always wondering how it works. But now as I gone through this experiment I know how it works. Now I can also do more advance thing by writing programs which are way easier than I thought.
