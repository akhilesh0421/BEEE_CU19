# BEEE LED Flasher
![Exp6](https://github.com/akhilesh0421/BEEE_CU19/blob/master/ultrasonic%20sensor%20interface-%20obstacle%20detector%20and%20distance%20measurement/UltraSonic%20Distance%20Sensor.png)

**Concept Used**:

The entire circuit is build in the concept of input and output. All the instruction executed by the Arduino are given to it using a program written in Arduino programming language.
UltraSonic Distance Sensor is used. Ultrasonic distance sensor determines the distance to an object by measuring the time taken by the sound to reflect back from that object. The frequency of the sound is somewhere in the range of ultrasound, this ensures more concentrated direction of the sound wave because sound at higher frequency dissipates less in the environment. A typical ultrasonic distance sensor consists of two membranes. One membrane produces sound, another catches reflected echo. Basically they are speaker and microphone.

**Learning & Observation**:

After doing this experiment I became familiar with circuit boards. Now I can distinguish between the input and output pins of a board easily. I also observed that how a simple change in code can affect the blinking of the LED.

**Problem Troubleshooting**:

Being new to Ardrino Programming I came acreoss some syntex errors, but I re-examined the code and corrected it.

**Precautions**:

Precautions that one should take while doing his project are given below:

1. Make sure you correctly select the board and port in the "Tools" option in Arduino IDE(Integrated Development Environment) .
2. Handle the Arduino board carefully as a simple damage can made the hardware useless.
3. Keep in mind that I should write program that is small in size as Arduino came with low inbuilt memory.
4. Carefully connect the positive terminal to the output pin of the circuit as any wrong connection would make flasher not to work.

**Learning Outcomes**:

Trough this experiment I came to learn about the Arduino board and working of it. Now as I gone through this experiment I know how it works. Now I can also do more advance thing by writing programs which are way easier than I thought.
