# LED Flasher

**Circuit Diagram**:

![Exp1](https://github.com/akhilesh0421/BEEE_CU19/blob/master/png/LED%20Flasher.png)

**Concept Used**:

The entire circuit is build in the concept of input and output. I give an input and according to it the circuits gives an output in the form of flashing of LED. The LED flashes according to the instruction uploaded in the Arduino board. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input and output pins. All the instruction executed by the board are given to it using a program written in Arduino programming language. For This experiment I use digital pin 7 as output. The positive terminal of the LED is connected to the digital pin 7 and the negative terminal is connected to the ground of the Arduino board.

**Learning & Observation**:

After doing this experiment I became familiar with circuit boards. Now I can distinguish between the input and output pins of a board easily. I also observed that how a simple change in code can affect the blinking of the LED.

**Problem Troubleshooting**:

Being new to Ardrino Programming I came acreoss some syntex errors, but I re-examined the code and corrected it.

**Precautions**:

Precautions that one should take while doing his project are given below:

1. Make sure you correctly select the board and port in the "Tools" option in Arduino IDE(Integrated Development Environment) .
2. Handle the Arduino board carefully as a simple damage can made the hardware useless.
3. Keep in mind that I should write program that is small in size as Arduino came with low inbuilt memory.
4. Carefully connect the positive terminal to the output pin of the circuit as any wrong connection would make flasher not to work.

**Learning Outcomes**:

Trough this experiment I came to learn about the Arduino board and working of it. Now as I gone through this experiment I know how it works. Now I can also do more advance thing by writing programs which are way easier than I thought.
