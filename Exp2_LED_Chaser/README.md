# BEEE LED Chaser
**Concept Used**:

The entire circuit is build in the concept of input-output and voltage supply. I give an input and according to it the circuits gives an output in the form of glowing of LED in a perticular pattern. The LED glows according to the instruction uploaded in the Arduino board. The board is equipped with sets of analog and digital input-output pins. All the instruction executed by the board are given to it using a program written in Arduino programming language. For This experiment I use digital pin 3, 4, 6 & 7 as output. The positive terminal of the LEDs are connected to these digital pin respectively and the negative terminal is connected to the ground of the Arduino board.

**Learning & Observation**:

After doing this experiment I became familiar with circuit boards and Arduino programming. Now I can distinguish between the input and output pins of a board easily. And make some patterns by using Arduino programming. I also observed that how a simple change in code can affect the blinking of the LED.

**Problem Troubleshooting**:

Wrong connections caused trouble. Re-examine the connections and code to overcome the trouble.

**Precautions**:

Precautions that one should take while doing his project are given below:

1. Make sure you correctly select the board and port in the "Tools" option in Arduino IDE(Integrated Development Environment) .
2. Handle the Arduino board carefully as a simple damage can made the hardware useless.
3. Keep in mind that I should write program that is small in size as Arduino came with low inbuilt memory.
4. Carefully connect the positive terminal to the output pin of the circuit as any wrong connection would make chaser not to work.

**Learning Outcomes**:

Trough this experiment I came to learn about the Arduino board and working of it. Before doing this experiment whenever I had seen a LED glowing in a perticular pattern as I thougt of while making the connections and writing the code.
